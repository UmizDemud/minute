      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I read some unsourced news, would you help me
        understand whether is it true or not?</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Assistant:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Absolutely, I&#39;d be happy to help verify the
        news for you. Please provide the details or the main points of the news you read. If you have a specific claim or
        topic in mind, include that as well.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yanukovich the old Ukrainian pm; started to murder
        his people</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Assistant:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The claim about former Ukrainian President
        Viktor Yanukovych allegedly murdering his people refers to the Euromaidan protests (2013-2014). Yanukovych&#39;s
        government faced protests after rejecting an EU association agreement. Clashes between protesters and security
        forces led to over 100 deaths, particularly during the February 2014 massacre. Whether Yanukovych directly ordered
        the killings is debated, but his government is blamed for the violence.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;What did UN offer to Ukraine then, for Ukraine to
        join UN?</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Assistant:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Ukraine is a founding member of the United
        Nations, joining in 1945 as part of the Soviet Union. Post-independence in 1991, Ukraine continued its membership
        as a sovereign state. The UN did not offer specific incentives for Ukraine to join; it was a founding
        member.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;What about NATO, why does it exist? Given there is
        no need to defend against USSR which disbanded in the second millennium</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Assistant:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;NATO was established in 1949 to provide
        collective defense against the Soviet Union. Post-Soviet Union, NATO continues to exist for collective defense,
        crisis management, conflict prevention, addressing new threats like terrorism and cyberattacks, and promoting
        democratic values.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Tell me what was the risk coming from Soviet towards
        these other countries? Why did they feel the need to defend themselves?</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Assistant:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The Soviet Union posed risks of military
        aggression, ideological expansion of communism, and geopolitical dominance. Countries needed to defend themselves
        to preserve sovereignty, political systems, and way of life. NATO was formed for collective defense and mutual
        security.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">User:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;They never used these weapons, so 1st point is down.
        The rest is down out of first principles. Then tell me did Soviet Union ever try to expand via war? If so where
        did they attack?</span></p>

          established communist governments in these countries, turning them into satellite states. This was achieved
          through a combination of direct military occupation, political manipulation, and support for local communist
          parties. </span><span class="c3">Tone</span><span class="c2">: The Soviet Union justified this as creating a
            buffer zone for its security and promoting socialist governance.</span></p>

        socialist governance and prevent a counter-revolution.</span></p>

        of Czechoslovakia to end the Prague Spring, a period of political liberalization. </span><span

            integrity of the socialist bloc.</span></p>

      <p class="c1"><span class="c3">Soviet Involvement</span><span>: The Soviet Union blockaded West Berlin in an attempt
        to force the Western Allies out of the city. The blockade was countered by the Berlin Airlift, where supplies were
        flown into West Berlin by the Allies. </span><span class="c3">Tone</span><span class="c2">: The USSR argued that
          it was protecting its interests and ensuring the demilitarization of Germany.</span></p>
      <h3 class="c4" id="h.t3rbxheyx0dt"><span class="c6 c3">7. Baltic States Annexation (1940)</span></h3>

        Involvement</span><span>: The Soviet Union occupied and annexed the Baltic states in 1940, following the

          aggression.</span></p>

      <ul class="c7 lst-kix_wstwgc7eemq0-0 start">
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Formality</span><span class="c2">: Soviet involvement ranged from direct
          military interventions (as in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Afghanistan) to more covert and indirect support (as
          in the Korean War and various proxy conflicts in the Middle East and Africa).</span></li>
        <li class="c0 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Tone</span><span class="c2">: The Soviet Union consistently framed its
          actions as part of a broader struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and capitalism. It portrayed itself as
          the defender of socialism and supporter of oppressed peoples and national liberation movements.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Soviet Union&rsquo;s expansionist activities were driven by a combination of
